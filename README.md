This is my first project I have created. Starting from July 1 - August 27. The goal of this project was to introduce myself into CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Using my experience of front-end design and Spring Boot, I wanted to experience building a full-stack application.
I chose a Bank in particular because it was simple. All it needed was to transfer fundings from bank account to bank account.
